How much damage will Flynn Rider take from the challenge, considering Jafar's ability Hidden Wonders?\nA: You use Flynn Rider - Charming Rogue's Here Comes the Smolder ability as soon as he's chosen for an opposing character's challenge. This means the challenging player must discard a card before any damage from the challenge is dealt to either character. In this case, you'll have to discard 1 of your 2 cards, so you'll have 1 card left. Jafar - Keeper of Secret's ability increases his Strength by the amount equal to the number of cards in your hand, so Jafar will have 1 Strength when he deals damage to Flynn Rider."

Both characters involved in a challenge receive damage at the same time and are also banished due to taking damage equal to or greater than their willpower at the same time if applicable. This means that at the time King Louie's ability is able to trigger he would already be banished and therefore no longer in play. Note that this does not change if King Louie is the character being challenged instead."

Ability, what characters can I choose for each part of her effect?\nA: When using the Who is the Fairest? Ability of The Queen - Commanding Presence you must choose an opponent's character to receive -4 strength. This means that you can only choose either Mickey Mouse or Maleficent to receive -4 strength in this example. When using the second part of the Who is the Fairest? Ability you may choose any character to receive +4 strength. In this example you may choose Mickey Mouse, Maleficent, The Queen or Flounder to receive +4 strength. Note that you must choose a character for each part of the ability so you are not able to decrease the strength of a character and not increase the strength of a character."

Dragon Gem's ability can only be used on characters who have Support as an ability. Even though Alice's ability mentions support she herself does not have Support and therefore cannot be returned to your hand by the ability of Dragon Gem."

Even if Let the Storm Rage on banishes your Ursula - Deceiver of All, you can still use her What a Deal ability.

The card played a second time with Ursula - Deceiver of All's ability What a Deal is placed on the bottom of your deck after its effect has finished."

When a character in play is put into a player's inkwell, the character first leaves play and then is put into the inkwell. This means Gramma Tala isn't in play to see a card being put into your inkwell, so you can't use her ability. Note that this is still the case if Gramma Tala was shifted and there's a card underneath her."
